# QuantArts authenticity verifier

With this repo users can verify the authenticity of the hashed certificate in the NFTs and the smart contract.

This authenticity hash or authHash is generated by hashing all the plain text of a public legal document, signed before the smart contract deployment,(avalaible on https://www.quantarts.com website) which certifies the authenticity of a specific artwork.

This authenticity document is unique for each artwork sold on the quantarts platform, so the authHash for each artwork is also unique. You can find this authHash inside the smart contract for the ERC721 token of each artwork, and also inside the NFTs metadata.

## Install
`yarn install`

## Start
`yarn start`

By lauching the script you will get a console message with the authHash that you can compare with the one inside your NFT or the erc712 contract. 

Also you can check inside the colections folder to see the authenticity contracts with its certificate in plain text inside a json.
